# Configure Docker Compose

## Brief

1. Add scriots to some folders for each service
2. Assign different services for different tasks. You may still reuse most of the resources
3. Map the paths in physical machine into some paths inside dockers
4. Option "command" would help you start the environment using different scripts


Hope it helps.
